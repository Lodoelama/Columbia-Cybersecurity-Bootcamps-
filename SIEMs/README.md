# Let's Go Splunking!
Instructions: 
You've been hired as an SOC analyst by Vandalay Industries, a company that uses Splunk for their security monitoring. Your task is to develop searches, custom reports, and alerts to monitor Vandalay's security environment and protect them from future attacks.

The assignment involves:

The Need for Speed: After a DDOS attack on Vandalay's web servers, you need to create a report to determine the impact of the attack on upload and download speed. You'll also create an additional field to calculate the ratio of the upload speed to the download speed.

Are We Vulnerable?: Given the frequency of attacks, you need to create a report determining how many critical vulnerabilities exist on the customer data server. Then, build an alert to notify your team if a critical vulnerability reappears on this server.

Drawing the (Base)line: A Vandaly server is experiencing brute force attacks into their administrator account. You need to analyze administrator logs that document a brute force attack, create a baseline of the ordinary amount of administrator bad logins, and determine a threshold to indicate if a brute force attack is occurring.

The deliverable for this assignment is the M19 Challenge Submission File, which should include screenshots where indicated and custom report results where indicated.
